This web application implements Tensorflow to allow people who are blind or suffer from sight *illness

# Installation
### For tensorflow
use this command to install everything tensorflow need:
```
pip install pillow Cython lxml jupyter matplotlib contextlib2 tf_slim
```
for more information about tensor flow can find out at https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/object-detection-using-tensorflow/

### Requirement
use this command to install all the requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# To Run This Web App
## run live object detection
use this command to run in streamlit: 

**Note that you have to cd inside the research file first**
```
streamlit run realtd1.py
```
## run text detection
use this command to run in streamlit:
```
streamlit run text-detection.py
```


# Note
Some of the elements / widgets will not work unless you change the directory to your local machine directory
eg. C://Document//research//images_text_detection

# What it does?
- It can help to detect object in front of the blinds and instruct him/her to go left or go right.
- It can help to detect text and convert to speech.

# Demo
